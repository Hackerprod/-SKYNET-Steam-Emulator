        /* the filter operation codes that go in the key part of IntPtr should be one of these:

            "map"
                - Server passes the filter if the server is playing the specified map.
            "gamedataand"
                - Server passes the filter if the server's game data (ISteamGameServer::SetGameData) contains all of the
                specified strings.  The value field is a comma-delimited list of strings to match.
            "gamedataor"
                - Server passes the filter if the server's game data (ISteamGameServer::SetGameData) contains at least one of the
                specified strings.  The value field is a comma-delimited list of strings to match.
            "gamedatanor"
                - Server passes the filter if the server's game data (ISteamGameServer::SetGameData) does not contain any
                of the specified strings.  The value field is a comma-delimited list of strings to check.
            "gametagsand"
                - Server passes the filter if the server's game tags (ISteamGameServer::SetGameTags) contains all
                of the specified strings.  The value field is a comma-delimited list of strings to check.
            "gametagsnor"
                - Server passes the filter if the server's game tags (ISteamGameServer::SetGameTags) does not contain any
                of the specified strings.  The value field is a comma-delimited list of strings to check.
            "and" (x1 && x2 && ... && xn)
            "or" (x1 || x2 || ... || xn)
            "nand" !(x1 && x2 && ... && xn)
            "nor" !(x1 || x2 || ... || xn)
                - Performs Boolean operation on the following filters.  The operand to this filter specifies
                the "size" of the Boolean inputs to the operation, in Key/value pairs.  (The keyvalue
                pairs must immediately follow, i.e. this is a prefix logical operator notation.)
                In the simplest case where Boolean expressions are not nested, this is simply
                the number of operands.

                For example, to match servers on a particular map or with a particular tag, would would
                use these filters.

                    ( server.map == "cp_dustbowl" || server.gametags.contains("payload") )
                    "or", "2"
                    "map", "cp_dustbowl"
                    "gametagsand", "payload"

                If logical inputs are nested, then the operand specifies the size of the entire
                "length" of its operands, not the number of immediate children.

                    ( server.map == "cp_dustbowl" || ( server.gametags.contains("payload") && !server.gametags.contains("payloadrace") ) )
                    "or", "4"
                    "map", "cp_dustbowl"
                    "and", "2"
                    "gametagsand", "payload"
                    "gametagsnor", "payloadrace"

                Unary NOT can be achieved using either "nand" or "nor" with a single operand.

            "addr"
                - Server passes the filter if the server's query address matches the specified IP or IP:port.
            "gameaddr"
                - Server passes the filter if the server's game address matches the specified IP or IP:port.

            The following filter operations ignore the "value" part of IntPtr

            "dedicated"
                - Server passes the filter if it passed true to SetDedicatedServer.
            "secure"
                - Server passes the filter if the server is VAC-enabled.
            "notfull"
                - Server passes the filter if the player count is less than the reported max player count.
            "hasplayers"
                - Server passes the filter if the player count is greater than zero.
            "noplayers"
                - Server passes the filter if it doesn't have any players.
            "linux"
                - Server passes the filter if it's a linux server
